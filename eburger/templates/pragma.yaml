version: 1.0.6
name: "Unspecific Solidity Pragma Detector"
severity: "Low"
precision: "High"
description: "Detects the usage of unspecific compiler pragmas that allow for a broader range of compiler versions than necessary, which can lead to unintended behavior or compiler warnings/errors with newer versions."
impact: "Using unspecific compiler versions can lead to unpredictable behavior in smart contracts due to differences in compiler versions."
action-items:
    - "Specify a more precise range of compiler versions in the pragma statement to ensure consistent behavior across different environments."
