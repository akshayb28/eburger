eBurger is a way to quickly interact with solidity smart contracts.

Running scanners won't win you competitions. spin up custom templates tailored to specific projects in minutes ([Wiki](https://github.com/forefy/eburger/wiki)).

## How it looks like

Here's a demo video

https://github.com/forefy/eburger/assets/152717707/68f8a41c-1dfd-42d2-82ab-38c7a167e030

Above example will also generate an AST, pythonified AST and a visual call flow graph under the folder `.eburger`.

Here's an example of an interactive graph
![eBurger](static/network_graph.png?raw=true "eBurger Network Graph")

## How to install
These 4 commands will make `eburger` available globally:
```
git clone https://github.com/forefy/eburger.git
cd eburger
pip3 install .
eburger -h
```

## How to run

### Simple examples
Simplest:
```bash
cd MyProject/
eburger
cat eburger-results.json
```
..

This will run a focused scan on one file and it's dependencies:
```
eburger -f ../ProjectToScan/src/SomeContract.sol
```
..


### Advanced usage
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/forefy/eburger/wiki/Advanced-usage).


## Adding templates
Templates can be added by adding new YAML files under the `templates/` directory.

If you are using eburger as a python package (installed with pip install), the templates location can be found with running `pip3 show eburger` or by running the tool on a contract and seeing the templates path printed to the console.

For documentation refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/forefy/eburger/wiki/Templates).


## Features
- YAML template support to query contract structure and raise insights for any matches
- Fast learning curve for adding templates, ability to customize templates to the current ongoing audit project
- Foundry and Hardhat support ‚ù£Ô∏è
- Call Flow Graph inspired by naming conventions of Solidity
- Search specific segments and highlight by parameter, function, contract etc
- Extensive control on graph layout
- View only the code related to the contract and not all the libraries in the world
- Community and free support via [Discord](discord.gg/WaVMpBtxdB)


## What is missing
As you can see, the tool is still in the making - what features would you like to see? let us know!
